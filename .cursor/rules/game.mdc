# Game

- ALWAYS run the game in full screen
- ALWAYS obey the game rules and mechanics defined in README.MD file
- NEVER break the game rules defined in README.MD file (Core Game Mechanics, Weapon Systems, Enemy System, Progression System, Bonus System)
- ALWAYS obey the asset names in the code (NEVER use a different asset name for existing assets defined in "assets" folder)
- Before starting every level there must be a delay mechanism which will show level name and a countdown from 5-1. After the delay the next level data must be loaded.
  Apply this logic to the first level as well. While counting down do not freeze the game, just apply delay for loading level JSON file.
- Formations of enemy aliens MUST be:
	"line" 
	"v"
	"circle"
	"diamond"
	"wave"
	"cross"
	"spiral"
	"star"
- Movement patterns of enemy aliens MUST be;
	"straight"
	"wave"
	"zigzag"
	"swarm" 
	"circular"
	"random"
	"chase"
	"teleport"
- Entry points of enemy aliens MUST be:
	"top_left"
	"top_center"
	"top_right"
	"left_top"
	"right_top"
- Level Manager and Level Editor ALWAYS must work according to the above information (formations, movement patterns, entry points etc.)
